# Basic Web Application Blueprint (TypeScript)

This blueprint demonstrates a fundamental web application architecture in AWS using TypeScript CDK, perfect for learning core AWS services covered in the Cloud Practitioner exam.

## 📋 Architecture Overview

This blueprint creates:

1. **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**
   - 2 Availability Zones
   - Public and Private subnets
   - NAT Gateway for private subnet internet access
   - Internet Gateway for public subnet

2. **EC2 Instance**
   - t2.micro instance (free tier eligible)
   - Apache web server
   - Located in public subnet
   - Security group allowing HTTP traffic

3. **S3 Bucket**
   - Versioning enabled
   - Server-side encryption
   - Used for static assets storage

4. **IAM Role**
   - Allows EC2 instance to access S3 bucket
   - Follows principle of least privilege

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This blueprint helps you understand:

- VPC networking and subnets
- EC2 instance deployment and configuration
- Security Groups and network access control
- S3 bucket creation and permissions
- IAM roles and policies
- Infrastructure as Code using AWS CDK with TypeScript

## 🔐 Required Permissions

Before deploying this blueprint, ensure your AWS credentials have the following permissions:

### IAM Permissions
- `iam:CreateRole`
- `iam:AttachRolePolicy`
- `iam:PassRole`
- `iam:CreateInstanceProfile`
- `iam:AddRoleToInstanceProfile`

### EC2 Permissions
- `ec2:CreateVpc`
- `ec2:CreateSubnet`
- `ec2:CreateInternetGateway`
- `ec2:CreateNatGateway`
- `ec2:CreateRouteTable`
- `ec2:CreateRoute`
- `ec2:CreateSecurityGroup`
- `ec2:CreateKeyPair`
- `ec2:RunInstances`
- `ec2:AllocateAddress`
- `ec2:AssociateAddress`
- `ec2:CreateTags`
- `ec2:Describe*`

### S3 Permissions
- `s3:CreateBucket`
- `s3:PutBucketVersioning`
- `s3:PutBucketEncryption`
- `s3:PutBucketPolicy`
- `s3:GetBucketLocation`

### CloudFormation Permissions
- `cloudformation:CreateStack`
- `cloudformation:UpdateStack`
- `cloudformation:DeleteStack`
- `cloudformation:DescribeStacks`
- `cloudformation:DescribeStackEvents`

### CDK Bootstrap Permissions
If this is your first CDK deployment, you'll also need:
- `s3:CreateBucket`
- `s3:PutObject`
- `iam:CreateRole`
- `iam:AttachRolePolicy`
- `ssm:PutParameter`

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

1. Navigate to the TypeScript directory:
   ```bash
   cd typescript
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Bootstrap CDK (first time only):
   ```bash
   cdk bootstrap
   ```

4. Navigate to the blueprint directory:
   ```bash
   cd blueprints/basic-web-app
   ```

5. Deploy the stack:
   ```bash
   cdk deploy
   ```

5. After deployment, note the outputs:
   - WebServerIP: Public IP of your web server
   - BucketName: Name of your S3 bucket

6. Access your web application:
   ```
   http://<WebServerIP>
   ```

## 💡 Cost Considerations

This blueprint uses:
- t2.micro EC2 instance (Free Tier eligible)
- S3 bucket (Free Tier eligible for first 12 months)
- NAT Gateway (NOT Free Tier eligible - approximately $0.045/hour)

To minimize costs:
- Destroy the stack when not in use
- Consider removing the NAT Gateway if not needed
- Monitor AWS Cost Explorer

## 🧹 Cleanup

To remove all resources:
```bash
cdk destroy
```
